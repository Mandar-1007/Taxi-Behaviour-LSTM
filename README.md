# Taxi-Behaviour-LSTM
A deep learning-based classification model that identifies taxi drivers based on their GPS trajectory data. This project leverages LSTMs to analyze sequential trip data, extracting spatial and temporal features to classify drivers with high accuracy. The model is trained with optimized hyperparameters and evaluated on real-world taxi datasets.
